The `firstDayOfWeek` prop defines which day of the week should be considered the **first day** in your calendar.
This prop is a number representing the days of the week from **0 to 6**, where:

- `0` = Sunday
- `1` = Monday
- ...
- `6` = Saturday

### Example

```tsx
import React from "react";
import Calendar from "react-evently-calendar";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Start the week on Saturday */}
      <Calendar firstDayOfWeek={6} />
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```
