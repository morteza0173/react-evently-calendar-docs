title: onChange Prop
---

The `onChange` prop is a callback function that is executed when a user selects a day in the calendar.
It receives the selected date (`Date`) and can be used to update state or pass the date to other parts of your application.

### Example

```tsx lineNumbers
import React, { useState } from "react";
import Calendar from "react-evently-calendar";

const App = () => {
  const [selectedDate, setSelectedDate] = useState<Date | null>(null);

  return (
    <div>
      <Calendar onChange={(date) => setSelectedDate(date)} />
      {selectedDate && (
        <p>Selected date: {selectedDate.toLocaleDateString()}</p>
      )}
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

## ⚠️ Important

If you are using the `renderDay` prop, make sure to read the **Important: Handling Day Selection** section on the [renderDay page](/en/docs/Customization/renderDay#%EF%B8%8F-important-handling-day-selection) for proper day selection handling.
